Budget & Forecasting Model
Business Problem

Organizations struggle to understand how changes in operating expenses impact profitability across different scenarios. Without structured forecasting, leadership cannot confidently plan for growth, cost control, or risk management.

Objective

To build a dynamic Excel-based financial model that:

Forecasts revenue and expenses for 12 months

Simulates Best Case and Worst Case scenarios (±30% expense variation)

Calculates Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income

Enables scenario-based financial planning

Key Insights

Revenue increases from ~$704K in Jan-25 to ~$882K in Dec-25 (~25% growth).

Gross margin maintained at 30% of revenue across scenarios.

Net income improves from ~$50K to ~$143K by year-end.

A ±30% shift in operating expenses significantly impacts annual profitability.

HR and Engineering expenses represent major cost concentration areas.

Financial Impact

Scenario modeling highlights how a 30% expense fluctuation materially changes net profit trajectory.

Demonstrates cost sensitivity and supports proactive expense management.

Enables leadership to simulate risk exposure before making budgeting decisions.
